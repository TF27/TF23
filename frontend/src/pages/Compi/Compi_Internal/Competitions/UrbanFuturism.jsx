            Smart cities are urban areas that utilise technology and data to improve the quality of life for residents, enhance sustainability, and optimise resource management. They integrate various technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics, and renewable energy systems, to create more efficient and connected urban environments.
            Urban planning plays a crucial role in the development of smart cities. It involves designing and organising urban spaces to accommodate the needs of the population while considering factors like infrastructure, transportation, housing, public services, and environmental sustainability. In the context of smart cities, urban planning focuses on leveraging technology and data-driven insights to improve city operations and enhance the overall urban experience. </div>
